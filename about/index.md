# Hello there,

I'm 23 and currenty living in Guapimirim, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I'm looking to intern experience in Data Science and Machine learning area. I got interested in this area after doing a Neural Network Subject in the University, i'm really excited to practice more of it and looking forward to see the results. I'll try to do some Machine learning projects and publish here in this site.
